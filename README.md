## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is my first time using Github, im not an english speaker, but im going to do this "read me" with the knowledge that I have.

To be honest, I'm not sure what to include here. I'm an average systems engineering student who wants to learn new things (I really love learning) and lately I've decided learn Github. I have had the opportunity to learn about HTML, C++, Java, and JavaScript, but I can't say that I fully master these languages, Im still a noob in each one of them. I am an artistically inclined person, I love drawing so much, listening to music, watching videos with a very good production, I like the cinema too, the photography and in general all kind of artistic expressions (mostly). I hope to still learning and doing new things :).
